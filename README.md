# lucidity
Chrome extension providing some convenience tricks for pull requests on GitHub

Supported features so far:
- Toggle collapse/expand of all files in the PR.
- Show a list of files present in the pull request. This allows overview of the structure modifications in the PR.
- Toggle wide mode. This makes the diffs view wider so no horizontal scrolling is needed when long lines of code exist in the PR.
